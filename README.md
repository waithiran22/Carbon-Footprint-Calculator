## Calculation Methodology
### Emission Factors
Our calculations use scientifically-validated emission factors from:

**-Transportation**: EPA and DEFRA standards

**-Electricity**: IPCC and IEA databases

**-Food**: Poore & Nemecek (2018) research

**-Shopping**: Industry lifecycle assessments

## Formulas

**Transportation =**
```monthly_emissions = distance_km × emission_factor × 30 days```

**Electricity =**
```appliance_emissions = (watts / 1000) × hours × emission_factor × 30 days```
